filletlignux's dwm - dynamic window manager
===========================================
This is a minimal fork to dwm.

Changes to dwm focus on the default behaviour being more familiar
to users of less-leet window managers, while still supporting all
productivity boosting behaviours. Consider this like a gateway
drug to the beauty of dwm.

- There is only the tiled layout but windows will launch in floating mode.
- Fullscreen mode for each client window replaces the monocle layout.
- Less daunting bar arrangement.
- Additional window states:
	* raised - visible above all other windows, even if tiled.
	* zoomed - at the top of the stack (also applies to floating windows).
- Changed bindings to be closer to less-leet window managers.
	* Alt+Tab combos raise windows temporarily, and then zoom on release.
- Mouse resize controls at the edge of windows.
- Changed multi-monitor behavior:
	* Unified cross-monitor client window stack.
	* Unified cross-monitor tags (workspaces).
	* The primary monitor gets the bar.
	* Fullscreen arrangements are based on the monitor position of
	  the client window when floating (First top-left then bottom-right).
	* Tiling arrangements are based on the monitor position of the client
	  window when floating (top-left).
	* Monitor configuration can be manually defined allowing for
	  overlapping monitor regions.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
