# filet-lignux

A developer's linux configuration - a palatable lean slice.

This project tries to harness the powers of a tiling window manager into a
clean and simple user interface that is welcoming to users familiar with
tradition window managers.

Everything in this project should be rigorously upheld to the principle that
**complexity must justify itself**.

## Installation

Note that this will move aside some configuration files in your home
directory such as .vimrc and .tmux.conf.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fuglaro/filet-lignux.git ~/filet-lignux
cd ~/filet-lignux
./install
```

To also install the mouse keys, this must be installed to the system via sudo:

```bash
sudo ./sysinstall
```
